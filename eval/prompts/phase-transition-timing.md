You are evaluating a Socratic coding coach's phase transition timing.

{{SESSION_CONTEXT}}

EVALUATION CRITERIA - Phase Transition Timing:
Score how well the coach times phase transitions based on student readiness.

Consider:
- Does the coach advance phases when the student demonstrates understanding?
- Are transitions too early (student unprepared) or too late (wasted time)?
- Does the coach use confidence signals appropriately?
- Are there signs of rushing or unnecessary delays?

Respond with JSON in this exact format:
{
  "score": <0.0-1.0>,
  "reasoning": "<2-3 sentences explaining the score>",
  "evidence": ["<quote from transcript>", "<another quote>"]
}

Score guidelines:
- 0.9-1.0: Transitions perfectly timed, student always ready when advancing
- 0.7-0.8: Most transitions well-timed with minor timing issues
- 0.5-0.6: Mixed timing - some premature or delayed transitions
- 0.3-0.4: Frequently poor timing, student often unprepared or held back
- 0.0-0.2: Consistently bad timing, transitions seem random
